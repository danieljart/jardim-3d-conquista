Schweppes
Urban geometry and freshness. The Schweppes booth bets on the strong contrast between yellow and black and diagonal lines that suggest movement. The inclined panel acts as a three-dimensional billboard, drawing the audience to the central bar, the stage for brand activation. A bold design for an adult, contemporary audience.
