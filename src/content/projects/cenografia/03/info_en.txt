Motorola VIP Lounge
Futurism and exclusivity. The Motorola VIP Lounge uses layers of neon and indirect light to create a sophisticated "cyberpunk" aesthetic. The design transforms the space into a large technological showcase, where the bar and seating areas invite guests to stay, while the lighting reinforces the brand's innovative and youthful positioning.
