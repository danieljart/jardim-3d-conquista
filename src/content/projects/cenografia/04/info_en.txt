McCain & Forno de Minas
Co-branding with harmony. The challenge was to unite two food giants in a cohesive space. We used warm colors (yellow and red) and welcoming materials to evoke "appetite" and comfort. The booth functions as a large living kitchen, ideal for tastings and relationship building, reinforcing the affective character of the brands.
