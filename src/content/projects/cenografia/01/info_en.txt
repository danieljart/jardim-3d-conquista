Monumentality and technology. The Comprint booth was designed to support the visual and physical weight of heavy industrial machinery without losing elegance. The overhead structure acts as a beacon in the exhibition hall, guiding visitors. The layout prioritizes circulation and technical demonstration, creating a robust and reliable business environment.
