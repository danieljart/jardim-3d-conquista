Vizion Car
Architecture as an urban totem. Vizion Car demanded an aggressive and modern night presence. We created a façade with metallic volumes and strategic red lighting that transforms the store into a visual landmark on the avenue. The showroom acts as an illuminated display case, showcasing the product (cars) like jewels.
