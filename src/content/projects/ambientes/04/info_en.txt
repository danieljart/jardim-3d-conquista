Ana Cecília Lima Clinic
In healthcare architecture, warmth is a priority. For the Ana Cecília Lima Clinic, we used light wood panels to warm the environment and reduce the anxiety typical of waiting rooms. The wine-colored signage and diffuse lighting bring feminine sophistication and tranquility, aligning the physical space with the delicacy of the service.
