Laman
One office, two atmospheres. The Laman project explores lighting versatility to redefine the workspace. In the first configuration, the RGB system creates an immersive, tech-forward environment ideal for creative sessions and brainstorming. In the second, warm, sober lighting transforms the room into an elegant corporate setting for client meetings. The result is a dynamic space that adapts to the function of the moment, reflecting the brand's multifaceted nature.
