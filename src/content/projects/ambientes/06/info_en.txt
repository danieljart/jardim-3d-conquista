Estapar
Efficiency and flow. The project for Estapar's self-service area focuses on User Experience (UX) in the physical environment. Clear visual signage and the institutional palette intuitively guide the customer to the terminals, reducing queues and confusion. A functional design that integrates operations with the mall's modern aesthetic.
